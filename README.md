# 1D Signal Denoising using a Convolutional Autoencoder

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a universal digital signal filter based on a neural network architecture, specifically a convolutional denoising autoencoder. The main objective is to reconstruct clean one-dimensional signals from its distorted versions. Due to its ability to extract meaningful features while preserving spatial structure, the convolutional autoencoder is especially suitable for signal denoising tasks.

## Key Features
* Architecture: 1D Convolutional Autoencoder built with TensorFlow/Keras.
* Signal Processing: Support for various signal types and noise models.
The project includes a robust data synthesis engine to simulate real-world conditions:

* **Signal Types**:
    * **Periodic**: Sine, Square, Sawtooth, and Triangle waveforms with randomized frequency, amplitude, and phase.
        * **Polyharmonic**: Complex signals generated by summing multiple sine waves with varying parameters.
            * **Aperiodic**: Damped sinusoidal signals representing transient phenomena.
            * **Noise Models**:
                * **White Noise**: Uniformly distributed additive noise.
                    * **Harmonic Noise**: Sinusoidal interference representing periodic distortions.
                        * **Impulse Noise**: Random high-amplitude spikes (Salt-and-Pepper style).
                            * **Mixed Noise**: Combinations of the above models to simulate high-complexity environments.

* Visualization: Comparative analysis of original, noisy, and reconstructed signals using Matplotlib.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* Language: Python
* Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
* Scientific Computing: NumPy
* Visualization: Matplotlib

## Architecture
The model utilizes a bottleneck architecture to learn a compressed representation of the signal, effectively learning to ignore the noise components.
* Encoder: Series of Conv1D and MaxPooling1D layers to extract spatial features.
* Decoder: Conv1D and UpSampling1D layers to reconstruct the signal to its original dimensions.
## Metrics & Evaluation
To evaluate the reconstruction quality, the system calculates:
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Used as the primary loss function during training.
* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: Measured in dB before and after denoising to quantify the signal quality improvement.

## Results
The model successfully reduces noise while preserving the essential features of the 1D waveform.
